Short Summary: 

The main task of this project, was to genarate the 10 escalation variables according to Blair and Sambanis and include them in the Model. The ICEWS is constantly changing and mainly the change of the event coder made it impossible to replicate Blair and Sambanis Dataset to 100%, but we got as close as possible. There is not much difference, so our approach seems to be sufficient. This is schon in this robustness analysis.
