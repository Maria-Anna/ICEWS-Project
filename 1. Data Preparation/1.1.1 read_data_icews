The following is done in the "read_data_icews" File:

1. Read the coded ICEWS event data from "dataverse.harvard.edu." for 1995-2020.
2. Data is read from TSV Format.
3. Coded event data for 2017 is downloaded in parallel, due to typos. 2017 typos were hardcoded, corrected and notified to "dataverse.harvard.edu".
4. Different event data sets can be filtered from the ICEWS 1995-2020 event data set.
5. Data set "events_africa" is used for the upcoming analysis: it contains all events where "Source.Country", "Target.Country" and "Country" refer to the same African country. Hence, only events that happen within an African country are considered.
6. Possible to filter the ICEWS event data set in various ways.
