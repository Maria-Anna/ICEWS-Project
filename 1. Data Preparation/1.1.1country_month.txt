In this R-File we are adding variables from cm_data to data_icews_cm, we created in 1_read_data_icews_cm.R
The icews data set contains only event data, but we are also insterested in structural variables such as gdp
and population and of course we need our target variable state based conflict. Thats the reason why we need
to merge the exisitng dataset with cm_data.

As a result we get a new data_icews_cm that contains 1320102 rows and 41 columns. Now for every event we have
the information whether a state based conflict occured at the same time the event happened and we also habe some 
additional information for the specific time the event occured, for example gdp

cm_data contains 19943 rows and 66 columns an it is one of the Dataframes used in
